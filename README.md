## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
For the intro and stats section, when I tried appending a new div element to both of those sections, for some reason the text was not showing up. I debugged and tried multiple different functions but it still was not working for these sections. It worked for the initial games container part, but not after so I was very confused by this.
